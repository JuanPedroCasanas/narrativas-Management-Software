This a a simple project i've made for my mother's medical office as a way to organize patients (Children) their parents, contact info, medical insurance as well as the reports she writes on them (And formatting them with a nice name so they don't get mixed up). In the future we might add the feature to handle the multiple offices schedules as well as the professionals

My focus is mainly on the backend (Which is what actually interests me) so the front end might not be very impressive and its also made in vainilla JS, i did try to maintain SOLID principles but again, the frontend was not my main interest but rather just a way to show off the backend work
